* Purpose
  Code to explore: one-html-file-with-react.

* Setup
- Install something to serve static files from a folder.  I use
  caddy.  And run it like this:

  #+begin_src sh
    ulimit -n 8192 && caddy -root .dist -port 1111 2>&1 > /dev/null &
  #+end_src

- Clone the repo and change directories into it.
- Run =build= via this command:

  #+begin_src sh
    ./run.sh build
  #+end_src

- The output files produced from the build are written to =.dist= which
  can be served via the above =Caddy= process.
- Finnaly, open your browser to [[http://localhost:1111][http://localhost:1111]]

  #+begin_src sh
    # on Mac:
    open http://localhost:1111
  #+end_src
