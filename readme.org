* Purpose
  Code to explore: one-html-file-with-react.

* Setup

- Install something to servce static files from a folder.  I use
  caddy.  And run it something like this:
  #+begin_src sh
    ulimit -n 8192 && caddy -root .dist -port 1111 2>&1 > /dev/null &
  #+end_src

- Clone the repo.
- Run the =build= command:
  #+begin_src sh
    ./run.sh build
  #+end_src
- The output of the build command is written to .dist which is served
  via the above =Caddy= process.
- On Mac open your browser to http://localhost:1111 
  #+begin_src sh
    open http://localhost:1111
  #+end_src
